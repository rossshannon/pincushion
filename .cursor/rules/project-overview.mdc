# Project Overview & Conventions

This project is a web application for saving bookmarks, built with React, utilising Redux for state management. It was recently refactored from an older jQuery implementation.

## Key Directories:

*   **`src/`**: Contains the main application source code.
    *   The main entry point is [src/index.js](mdc:src/index.js).
    *   **`src/@redux/`**: Houses all Redux-related files, including slices, selectors, and the store configuration.
        *   Focus is currently on adding tests for slices like [src/@redux/authSlice.js](mdc:src/@redux/authSlice.js).
    *   **`src/components/`**: Contains reusable React components.
    *   **`src/__testing__/`**: Centralised directory for all test files (Jest/React Testing Library). Standard practice is to have corresponding test files for Redux slices and selectors.

## Testing Strategy:

*   Tests are located in [src/__testing__](mdc:src/__testing__).
*   The primary focus for new tests is on Redux logic (slices and selectors).
*   Component tests also reside within the central testing directory.

## Legacy Code:

*   Efforts have been made to remove legacy jQuery code. Any remaining instances should be identified and replaced with React/vanilla JS alternatives.
